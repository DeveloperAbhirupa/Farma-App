# Farma-App
Farma is an app for farmers or businessmen in the Agriculture industry that helps with supply chain management for yielding optimal profit. Every product in that is there is a result of being distributed across whats called a supply chain. The path that a commodity takes through manufacturing, transport, distribution centers, etc. is called the supply chain. The supply chain for most businesses is riddled with inefficiencies. Late drivers, bad weather conditions, suboptimal planning, timing issues, the list of things that can go wrong is endless and most of this coordination is done by humans. AI can be used to optimize this entire pipeline, from planning to autonomous transport. We plan to use Reinforcement Learning that automates the entire process of Supply chain management for farmers, using a simple click of a button. All transactions that take place between the manufacturing entity, and the suppliers are powered using a Blockchain, hence ensuring authenticity. Further, users of Farma can easily communicate effeciently using in-built calling features that are powered by Agora API. Farma also offers crop safety using simple Computer Vision algorithms. We plan to provide CCTV services on lands that can monitor the crops, and detect any malicious activities, and raise alerts to the respective user using Agora API.
